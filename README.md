# CircularArrayRotation (From HackerRank.com)

John Watson performs an operation called a right circular rotation on an array of integers, [a0, a1, ...an-1]. After performing one right circular rotation operation, the array is transformed from [a0, a1, ...an-1] to [an-1, a0, ..., an-2].

Watson performs this operation k times. To test Sherlock's ability to identify the current element at a particular position in the rotated array, Watson asks q queries, where each query consists of a single integer, m, for which you must print the element at index m in the rotated array (i.e., the value of am).


## Input Format

The first line contains 3 space-separated integers, n, k, and q, respectively. 
The second line contains n space-separated integers, where each integer i describes array element ai(where 0 <= i < n). 
Each of the q subsequent lines contains a single integer denoting m.


## Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^5

1 <= ai <= 10^5

1 <= k <= 10^5

1 <= q <= 500

0 <= m <= n-1


## Output Format

For each query, print the value of the element at index m of the rotated array on a new line.
